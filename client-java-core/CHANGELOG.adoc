=== Changes

=== 3.3
- Support array values in client side evaluation. This was rolled out to the other SDKs but not Java. The SDK can now be given an array of attributes and compare them against an array of values in a Strategy.

=== 3.2
- Percentage calculator was not consistent from run to run, meaning percentage values could be evaluated differently between runs.

=== 3.1 
- New Edge APIs required some changes to polling and internal
classes.

=== 2.8
- When using a Client Evaluated Feature context, the client was not getting reused if you used the default
mechanism. Now the close() method for the context does nothing, and you need to issue a close on the 
`EdgeFeatureHubConfig` itself. Server Evaluated Feature contexts remain the same and you should close them
individually as they have their own connections.
- The Android client would not attempt to connect unless it had an attribute set when operating in 
Server Evaluated Feature mode. Now when a context change is requested and it has never triggered a request,
it will always do so.
- Some internal classes have changed packages (FeatureValueType, some others)
- Some libraries have been upgraded
- The client now tells the server what client it is using, which version of the client and which version of the
server API it expects.
- The client has been compiled against the new 1.1.3 API but does not currently use its functionality.

=== 2.3  
- Expose analytic collector, readyness listener, readyness state, and value interceptor properties on the FeatureHubConfig
- Respect context when using feature listeners

=== 2.2 
- fixed issue where no header for server eval context was causing NPE at times.
